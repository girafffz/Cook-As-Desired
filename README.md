# Cook-As-Desired

Cook as Desired is a web app for searching for recipes online that was developed to fulfill the academic requirements of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive second project.

<br/>

# Description

Searching for recipes online is as simple as putting keywords into Google or your favorite culinary websites like Tasty. However, do you get distracted by the numerous flashing commercial banners that appear all over the page?

Cook as Desired is my attempt to create a simple online tool that allows users who have not install ad blockers to search for and read recipes without being distracted by advertisements.

<!-- The live version of the game is accessible from this [link](https://girafffz.github.io/Tug-of-War/). -->

<br/>

## Approach taken

The web app is developed using Tasty API, JavaScript and React.js featuring the following:

1. A search bar where the user can enter keywords.
2. The results are displayed aesthetically in card format with minimum text.
3. The user can read the recipe's details by clicking the "View More" button.

<br/>

## Challenges faced

- It has been difficult to extract meaningful data for presentation due to the nature of the data returned from the API.
